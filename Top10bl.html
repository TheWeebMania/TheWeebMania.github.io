I love sports anime and also the stunts and dances were amazing, they were choreographed by a real ice skater instructor/choreographer and it was based on real ice skaters (excluding the love story ofc) who makes it more awesome because of the effort and realness portrayed in the anime. Fun and friendship was emphasized even if it’s an international competition. Yuri Katsuki's a solo skater and that is a heavy responsibility for representing his own country, japan. Insecurities and doubts filled his heart and mind causing the downhill in his career which made him more depressed. His friends, coach, fans, competitors and rival helped him to finally come back to his senses and made him to go back on track in the skating competition. Its funny how your rival or opponents inspire you more to reach your goal, even though its for Viktor hihi. I also love the opening song History Maker by Fujioka, its so insipiring and somewhat represents the aim of the story.

As the title implies it is a story about classmates Kasekabe Hikaru and - in a all boys school. It was super cuteeeee, driven by hormones made them do selfish and irrational things to pursue love. Jealousy was also present, Hikaru was a guitarist in a band making him popular to the girls. Insecurities because of the hidden and taboo relationship made their love vulnearble. Being young really has both positive and negative effects on relationship, but also as time passed they slowly became an adult, it gave them a big question is what will happen in thw future? Being a 3rd Year highschool, they have to decide on what they wanted to be, their course, and choose a university. -- choosing a far university, made Hikaru mad for not consulting or even telling him their plans. But eventually making up as they finally understood each sides and finally feel how they love each other.

Haru visited his mom at Canada for the summer and he unexpectedly met Ren, his mother's adopted son. Coming from the orphanage and experienced child abuse, it made socialization hard for Ren and isolated himself with the dogs. Living like a dog made taking care of him difficult, he sleeps in the garage, only eating once a day and spending his day in the forest. But Haru patiently teach him how to act like a human, from sleeping in a bed, wearing shoes, taking a bath, etc. which deepen his relationship with Ren. As the summer end, Haru left Canada and return to Japan to his Father's family. It made Ren sad but Haru promised that he will bring Ren to Japan when the time is right. After returning to Japan, Haru met an unfortunate accident which made him lose his father and stepmom and lose his memories of Ren. Years passed and Ren went to Japan and lived with Haru saying that it is what he promised

Having a large age gap and a brocon makes their love complicated. It also showed the importance family and friends, how they helped Haru and his brothers progress and meet his goals. Funny how Haru made so much connections as Host helped him get free and discounted things.

The most painful part is Yuki left without resolving their fight. It only brought painful memories, regrets and blames his/herself for fighting or arguing with each other. Regretting past actions hoping it will change or atleast make a difference. After being alone into slowly moving on, the story progressed as Mafuyu finally admits and faced his real feeling for Yuki. Finally letting go and amd finding a new boyfriend, just kidding, he finally let go of regrets, hidden emotion and guilt which hinders him from expressing his feelings and finding closure. The song Fuyunohanashi or Wintertale was the perfect song for expressing Mafuyu's feelings and his scream at the second chorus hit me hard. When he sang it's the time that he finally accepted everything even though its painful and saying he will finally look forward for tomorrow.

One night he met ---, his newly found friend where they took care of rhe cat at --- house not knowing he is the bear killer's brother.

Insults were thrown against the written lyrics, which made ---- mad and inspired him to write a song which later become a hit. Their relationship was hot and cold due to Yuki’s past which hinders him to fully commit and love ----. It is a exaggerated comedy with a heavy topic about dwelling in the past instead of moving forward. As --- forces to enter Yuki’s life and make him his lover. It’s a frustrating love story because of fear and painful past that affected his decision and hurting him in the process. --- should give up’ I became frustrated and laughing at the same time because --- is a stupid and airhead that doesn’t know when to give up on Yuki even if he know his past. 

	Giving up on someone is sometimes the easiest choice especially if he/she doesn’t want you around but it may also be a selfish decision that may lead to lifetime regret. Shutting away someone because of fear of being hated is what Yuki did, some thought it is selfish but it is his way of concealing and running away from his painful past which he never wanted to remember. It negatively affects his mental, social and physical state.

The main story about an Author and a freeloading friend’s brother, at first the author, Akihiko Usami, is in love with his friend, Takahiro, entrusting his brother as he transfer to another town because of work and their love bloomed as they live in the same condo. A dumped and tsundere Professor and an aspiring social worker but ended up as Pediatrician, their relationship is full of misunderstandings because of the little time they spend together because of work but somehow their relationship became stronger as they clear each understanding. A divorced-35-years-old Professor and 1st Year College student, the funny thing is that the student is his divorced wife’s brother that makes things a little bit complicated, professing his love after the divorce but that’s not all, they have huge 17 years age gap. 

Their stories were complicated, full of misunderstandings and hiding of true feelings that widens their relationship. It’s fun to watch because of petty problems that starts huge fight and arguments; they taught deep lessons that made me realize the importance of communication, because it is the foundation of trust in a relationship. That even if you care or love them it may not be enough for them how you love and care for them, they may even misunderstood it if its not directly said to them. It was expressed in a parent and child relationship which is the most common situation. Some may not realize beacause its not clearly pointed out or not expressed properly which makes the realtionship vulnerable.

The main story is about the Ex-lovers Boss and his the-one-who-got-away Employee where they try to remember their love in high school while chasing each other and fall in love once again. A Manga Author and his childhood friend Editor, it is a love triangle where the Manga Author had a hard time choosing between a friend and his jealous lover because of his dense and insensitive nature. Last but not the least, an editor falling in love in a bookseller’s face whose a fan of the mangas he produced, they had a hard time in their relationship due to the age gap and shallow love because he thought he only love his handsome face. 
It may seem like cliché stories but it still has it charm and it is Boy’s Love anime which makes it more exciting. it has a lot of doubts and ‘What if?s’ to conceal their feeling that  makes their love unrequited and People, past and gender which hinders and eventually strengthen their relationship instead of destroying it. Every problem is a stepping stone and their relationship is a huge responsibility considering they re both men which makes everything harder.</p></div>
